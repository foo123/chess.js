## ChessGame

Represents a game of chess, the possible moves, when the game is over and who wins.  
version: 1.0.0

## ChessBoard

Represents the board of chess in HTML and in Terminal.  
version: 1.0.0

## ChessSearch

Implements various search methods for a best move in a game of chess.  
version: 0.11.0

Methods:
* Alpha Beta Search
* MTD(f) Search
* Best Node Search
* Monte Carlo Tree Search
* Hybrids of above methods

A user-defined evaluation function can be used, else a custom-crafted evaluation function is used which, although simple and fast, produces quite good results (see `tournament.js` for some tentative results).
